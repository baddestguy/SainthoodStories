Event_EndgameNormal,"The air is different—lighter, calmer. The weight of the past days has lifted, though not entirely. You have done much, but there is a lingering sense of unfinished tasks, opportunities lost.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameNormal,"The crew nods in quiet acknowledgment as you step aboard, the sea calm and welcoming. The journey to the Distant Lands stretches before you, its horizon aglow with promise, though faint shadows still cling to the edges of your mind—those you could not help, the prayers you did not fulfill.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameNormal,"The wind fills the sails, and the island begins to shrink in the distance. The lives you touched, though incomplete, ripple out in the calm waters behind you. There is peace in your heart, though not without a quiet whisper of what might have been.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameNormal,"The Distant Lands await. You are worthy, but in the vast sea of life, even your incomplete efforts were enough to guide you toward the light.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameBest,"The ship's sails billow with grace.

Event_EndgameBest,"When you step aboard, you are not alone. Though they remain on the island, their prayers ascend like incense, rising to the heavens.

Event_EndgameBest,"The sails fill with a wind not of this world, and the sea glows with the light of the Distant Lands, beckoning you forward. There is no hesitation in your heart. Every step you took, every act of charity, every prayer uttered has led to this moment. The island grows smaller, but the bonds you've forged remain, eternal and unbroken.",,,,,,

Event_EndgameWorst,"The ship appears on the horizon, its silhouette dark against the fading light. Yet as it draws near, there is no relief, no solace in its arrival—only the cold wind and a deep, gnawing emptiness. You step toward it, but with each step, the weight of all you left undone presses heavier upon your soul.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameWorst,"Charity unoffered. Faith unraveled. The island feels no lighter for your presence, and now the ship that should carry you away feels distant, as if it doesn't truly belong to you.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameWorst,"You reach the dock, but the crew does not extend a hand. They look past you, as if they cannot see you. The ship groans and creaks, but makes no move to welcome you aboard. The sea before you is vast, dark, and uncaring—a reflection of the emptiness left in the wake of your inaction.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameWorst,"No prayers guide your path, no hands lift you from the shadows of failure. The ship begins to drift away, leaving you behind. Alone. Unmoored. The Distant Lands will remain forever unseen, for those without charity and faith have no place in their light.",,,,,,
Event_EndgameWorst,"And so, you are left—bound to the island, an eternal reminder of what was lost.",,,,,,
Event_SpiritualCrisis,"The ship looms on the horizon, its approach slow and ominous. As it reaches the shore, there is no gleam of hope in its sails—only the dim light of uncertainty, flickering like a candle near its end. You step forward, but your feet falter, for something deep within you trembles.",,,,,,
Event_SpiritualCrisis,"You board, but the weight of your own doubt hangs heavy, sinking into the very bones of the vessel. The crew is silent, their eyes empty, for they recognize the void that shadows your soul—the faith you failed to nurture, the prayers left unanswered, the moments of trust forsaken.",,,,,,
Event_SpiritualCrisis,"The sea stretches out before you, vast and indifferent. Its depths mirror your heart, dark and fathomless. The journey ahead is shrouded in mist, the horizon swallowed by gloom. No guiding light will lead you now, for the flame of faith that should burn within has flickered, weak and fading.",,,,,,
Event_SpiritualCrisis,"And so, you drift—rudderless, lost in the cold expanse of uncertainty—toward a distant shore that remains ever out of reach.",,,,,,
Event_TownRiots,"The ship arrives, but it is not the vessel of salvation you had hoped for. Its hull, battered and worn, groans like the souls you failed to lift. No joyful welcome awaits you here. Only cold, indifferent faces stare back—silent witnesses to your shortcomings.",,,,,,
Event_TownRiots,"You step aboard, but the weight of your journey presses down upon you. The winds howl, mocking your meager efforts. Those in need—the lost, the hungry, the forsaken—linger in the recesses of your mind. Their eyes, hollow and yearning, are etched into your memory, forever unanswered.",,,,,,
Event_TownRiots,"The sea churns, violent and unforgiving, much like the void left by your absence. The ship sways, unbalanced, as if questioning your right to sail toward the Distant Lands. You have left, but the stain of neglect clings to you, a burden far heavier than the ship can carry.",,,,,,
Event_TownRiots,"Now, you drift—adrift in the endless abyss—toward a distant shore that may never come.",,,,,,

He was eventually tried and found guilty under the Act forbidding priests to minister in England, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered, at the age of thirty-three. On 25 October 1970, Roberts was canonized by Pope Paul VI.",,,,,,
JOSE_Bio,"Brochero was born in Argentina as the fourth of ten children to Ignacio Brochero and Petrona Davila. At age 16, he commenced his studies to become a priest at the College Seminary of Our Lady of Loreto, where he met future president Miguel Ángel Juárez Celman.

Brochero founded a home known as the Houses of Exercises in 1875, and later established a school for girls in 1880. He was known to travel long distances in Argentina on the back of a mule dressed in a sombrero and a poncho to serve the needs of the Christian faith throughout his huge parish. 

He cared for the sick during the cholera epidemic of 1867 and contracted leprosy during his travels, which eventually led to blindness and deafness towards the end of his life. ",,,,,,
JOSEPH_Bio,"Balikuddembe was enrolled as a catechumen and baptized in 1882, taking the baptismal name of ""Joseph"". After the Catholic missionaries, for reasons of security, moved to the southern end of Lake Victoria, Balikuddembe became leader of the Christians.

Now Danieri Mwanga II succeeded to the throne as King, and began to crack down on Christian missionaries and converts in his country, executing the British Anglican bishop James Hannington and his companions on October 29, 1885, despite Balikuddembe's pleas.

Mwanga, viewing Balikuddembe's disapproval as disrespectful, ordered him executed. He was beheaded and his body was thrown onto a pile of burning firewood. St. Joseph Mukasa Balikuddembe Parish in Kisoga is named after him.",,,,,,
KATERI_Bio,"Kateri was born in the Mohawk village of Ossernenon. She contracted smallpox during an epidemic which scarred her face at a very young age and killed her entire family. She subsequently moved into the care of her uncle who was the chief of a Mohawk clan.

Trouble came when she refused to marry, despite the many attempts by her adoptive parents. She later converted to Catholicism, taking a vow of chastity and pledging to marry only Jesus Christ, a decision that was met with disdain among her adoptive parents and neighbors.

She eventually moved to a Christian native community south of Montreal, where she practiced a very devout lifestyle. She died at the young age of 24. Her name, Kateri, is the Mohawk form of Catherine, which she took from St. Catherine of Siena.",,,,,,
KATHARINE_Bio,"Born in Philadelphia to a prominent and wealthy banker, Katharine Drexel received a solid education from private tutors and traveled throughout the United States and Europe. 

Sometime after receiving spiritual direction from Father James O' Connor, she began her six-month postulancy at the Sisters of Mercy Convent in Pittsburgh in 1889. Shortly after taking her vows, she dedicated her life and fortune to working for the American Indians and African-Americans in the Western United States.

By the time of her death, she had more than 500 Sisters teaching in 63 schools throughout the country and she established 50 missions for Native Americans in 16 different states. She was canonized on October 1, 2000 by Pope John Paul II.",,,,,,
LORENZO_Bio,"Born around the year 1600 in the Philippines to a Chinese father and a Filipino mother, Lorenzo Ruiz fled the country to Japan after being accused of the murder of a Spaniard.

Unfortunately for him, Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa Shogunate, who were persecuting Christians. Lorenzo and his companions were immediately arrested for being Christians and ordered to recant their faith. On refusal to do so, they were imprisoned for two years.

They were later taken to Nagasaki to be tortured and killed, but Lorenzo and his companions were faithful until the very end. He was canonized at the Vatican on October 18, 1987.",,,,,,
MAGDALENE_Bio,"Born in 1611 near Nagasaki, Magdalene was the daughter of a Christian couple who were martyred during the reign of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Magdalene later served as an interpreter for the friars Francis of Jesus Terrero and Vincent of Saint Anthony Simoens and, in 1625, became a tertiary of the Order of Augustinian Recollects.

As the friars were tortured and killed under severe persecution, with many Christians apostatizing, Magdalene turned herself to the authorities, declaring herself a Christian. She was tortured for thirteen days, enduring suffocation, being hung upside down over a pit of offal on a gibbet, and finally, drowning. She died at age 23.",,,,,,
MARIAM_Bio,"Saint Mariam Thresia, an Indian Syro-Malabar Catholic nun, was the founder of the Congregation of the Holy Family and was best known for her frequent visions and ecstasies, as well as receiving the stigmata.

Throughout much of her life, Thresia received several different spiritual experiences including prophecy, healing, aura of light, frequent ecstasies and levitations. Because of the extreme nature of some diabolical attacks and vexations, Thresia was subjected to several different exorcisms by the Venerable Joseph Vithayathil, under the Bishop's orders.

In 1926, after receiving an injury on her leg which eventually proved to be fatal, St. Mariam Thresia died with her final words being: ""Jesus, Mary and Joseph; I give you my heart and my soul.""",,,,,,
MARIE_Bio,"St. Marguerite D'Youville, born in Quebec, studied under the Ursulines, married Francois D'Youville in 1722, and became a widow in 1730.

The Grey Nuns established schools, hospitals and orphanages throughout Canada, the U.S., South America, and Africa and are famous for their work among the Eskimos.",,,,,,
MONICA_Bio,"Saint Monica, also known as Monica of Hippo, is the mother of St. Augustine. Born in 331 A.D., Monica was married at a young age to the Roman pagan Patricius and had three children including Augustine. She managed to convert her husband and mother-in-law to Christianity after several years.

Two of her kids entered the religious life, but Augustine cared little for Christianity, so Monica sent him off to Carthage for schooling. To her dismay, Augustine returned a Manichaean, but with great patience, Monica prayed for her son for several years, and with the help of St. Ambrose, Augustine finally converted to the faith.

She was buried at Ostia, and her body was removed during the 6th century to a hidden crypt in the church of Santa Aurea in Osta, near the tomb of St. Aurea of Ostia. The city of Santa Monica in California is named after her.",,,,,,
MOSES_Bio,"Moses, an Egyptian government official's slave until his dismissal, was part of a violent gang of robbers until he took shelter with some monks in a colony in the desert of Wadi El Natrun, near Alexandria. 

Moses was so moved by the monks that he gave up his old way of life, became a Christian, was baptized and joined the monastic community at Scetes. He proved to be a prophetic spiritual leader, settling disputes within and outside the community of monks and sometimes carrying a leaking sack of sand on his shoulders to show humility.

After word came of an attack on the monastery by a group of Berbers, Moses ordered the others to leave while staying behind, believing his life had come full circle. He was joined by seven others, and together they were martyred by the bandits around 405 A.D.",,,,,,
PEDRO_Bio,"Saint Pedro Calungsod, a Filipino Roman Catholic, was a skilled sacristan and teacher of catechism. He accompanied Blessed Diego Luis de San Vitores to the Marianas Islands where many received the sacraments, especially that of baptism.

A plot to have him killed began when a criminal named Choco began spreading false rumors that the baptismal water contained poison. Given that some sickly infants who were baptized eventually died, the story stuck and people began to despise the missionaries.

It came to head when the local chief, who now opposed the missionaries because of the rumors, learned of his newborn daughter's baptism. A violent assault followed, and Pedro, along with San Vitores, were killed in the attack. On October 21, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI canonized Calungsod in Saint Peter's Square.",,,,,,
ROQUE_Bio,"Roque Gonzalez de Santa Cruz was the son of noble Spanish parents, ordained at twenty-three, and joining the Society of Jesus after a decade of preaching to the Indians of Paraguay in remote regions.

In 1628, Father Roque Gonzalez met his untimely end when a raiding party, led by a powerful ""medicine man"", attacked the Mission, killing him and setting the chapel on fire. He was canonized in 1988 by Pope John Paul II.",,,,,,
SANMARTIN_Bio,"St. Martin de Porres was born in Lima, Peru. Being of mixed race, he experienced a great deal of ridicule as a young boy. The law in Peru at the time prevented Africans and Native Indians from becoming full members of religious orders, so Martin began as a servant boy at the Dominican Convent of the Rosary.

Martin worked hard and made his way up from church officer to lay brother and finally took his vows as a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic, granted by the prior who disregarded the racial laws that prohibited his entry. He cared for many people unconditionally, from Spanish nobles to African slaves.

Towards the end of his life, Martin fell very ill with chills, fevers and tremors causing him agonizing pain. He would suffer this illness for almost a year until his eventual death in 1639.",,,,,,
VICTOR_Bio,"Victor Maurus, a Mauretanian native, was a soldier in the Praetorian guard. A Christian from a very young age, Maurus was sent to the Hippodrome in the presence of the Roman emperor Maximian Herculean to recant his faith.

Refusing to betray his beliefs, Maurus was whipped, imprisoned and, after an almost miraculous escape, imprisoned again. He was then dragged into a nearby elm wood and decapitated around the year 303.

His relics are now part of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, built by Ambrose, fourth-century bishop of Milan.",,,,,,

Mission_18,"""The gentleman suspected the thief but had no proof, so he took the case to the judge. ",,,,,,
Mission_18,"""The thief, fearing punishment, sought advice from a wise man, promising him half the stolen money if the thief got away with his crime.""",,,,,,
Mission_18,"""The wise man agreed, and advised him to dress in rags and act crazy, and to only answer with 'Moo' to any question.""",,,,,,
Mission_18,"""The thief did as advised, and the judge, thinking the thief was crazy, dismissed the case!""",,,,,,
Mission_18,"""However, when the wise man came for his share of the stolen money, the thief only replied 'Moo'.

As such. The wise man was left with nothing.""",,,,,,

Mission_19,"""Good morning.""",,,,,,
Mission_19,"""I've got another tale for you.""",,,,,,
Mission_19,"""Long ago, leopards didn't know how to hunt. 

A leopard asked a skilled cat to teach him, and she agreed, teaching him to hide, move noiselessly, and use his left side when springing on prey.""",,,,,,
Mission_19,"""After practicing these skills, the leopard initially succeeded but, in a tough season, soon struggled to catch food. 

Driven by hunger, he ate the cat's kittens while she was away, forgetting her kindness!""",,,,,,
Mission_19,"""In anger, the cat refused to teach him further, and thus, the leopard never learned how to catch animals passing on his right side.""",,,,,,
Mission_19,"""The end.""",,,,,,
Mission_19,"""I'm sure there's a lesson to be learned here.""",,,,,,
Mission_20,"""Good morning.""",,,,,,
Mission_20,"""Here's another interesting one about a well known spider called Anansi.""","""I'm skipping story time today because trivia is about a significant event in Kongo history.""",,,,,
Mission_20,"""Once, Anansi decided to gather all the world's wisdom into a pot, thinking he could keep it all to himself.""","""In the late 15th century, King Nzinga a Nkuwu of Kongo embraced Christianity and began a relationship with the Portuguese.""",,,,,
Mission_20,"""He tied the pot to his front and tried to climb a tall tree to hide it, but no matter how hard he tried, the pot kept getting in the way.""","""This period marked a significant shift in our kingdom, leading to both great opportunities and challenges.""",,,,,
Mission_20,"""His son, watching from below, called out, 'Father, why don't you tie the pot to your back instead?'""","""It was quite a turning point. 

One might say it was a... <b>cross roads</b> in our history!""",,,,,
Mission_20,"""Furious that his own child outsmarted him, Anansi angrily threw the pot to the ground, scattering wisdom all over the earth. Thus, wisdom became available to everyone.""","""Hahah-

Hey. Where are you going...?""",,,,,
Mission_20,"""The end.""",,,,,,
Mission_20,"""Wisdom is one of the great virtues, in my opinion. You would be wise to remember that.""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""Hello dear, slept well?""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""I've got a tale about the tortoise and the birds. Have a listen.""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""Once, Tortoise, who was always full of tricks, heard the birds were invited to a grand feast in the sky.""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""He sweet-talked the birds into giving him feathers to fly with them, and said they should all take new 'dinner names' for the occasion.""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""Tortoise, of course, called himself 'All of You,' so when the food was served, and the hosts said it was for 'all of you,' Tortoise ate everything!""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""Furious at his greed, the birds took back their feathers, leaving him to fall from the sky. 

He landed hard on his back, cracking his shell.""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""The end.""",,,,,,
Mission_21,"""I don't think this one's meaning is hard to figure out.""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""Good morning!""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""The rain has stopped. But it's getting so chilly lately, I'm getting concerned.""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""We'll save the concern for later though. Right now it's story time! Check this one out.""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""One day, a leopard caught a jackal and was ready to make a meal of him.""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""But the jackal, being sly, begged for a last request. He asked the leopard to let him sing before he died, saying it would make his meat tastier.""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""Curious, the leopard agreed, and the jackal began to howl loudly.""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""The noise brought hunters running, and in the commotion, the jackal slipped away while the leopard was forced to flee for his life!""",,,,,,
Mission_22,"""The end.""",,,,,,

Mission_24,"""Good morning.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""I see you're adjusting to the weather. Or at least trying to.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""I made some snow angels out back. It was pretty fun! Though I wouldn't recommend it unless you're bundled up pretty well.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""I was having a chat with Christie the Weather-Lady about the weather.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""It turns out that we are experiencing a four-season climate, instead of the usual two.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""All my life I've only ever known the Dry Season and the Wet Season.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""And now I'm told we've gone through Spring, Summer, Fall, and now Winter.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""Isn't that amazing?""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""I mean, there's still the question of how this is at all possible, but I think there might be a deeper meaning to the seasons than we are witnessing at the moment.""",,,,,,
Mission_24,"""Let me think on it a while.""",,,,,,
Mission_25,"""Good morning dear.""",,,,,,
Mission_25,"""Still able to cope with your tasks I hope? I know things are getting difficult these days.""",,,,,,
Mission_25,"""I've been thinking about the cycle of the seasons, and I'm reminded that life, too, is a cycle.""",,,,,,
Mission_25,"""Life comes into this world in Spring, and leaves this world in Winter.""",,,,,,
Mission_25,"""How much can one achieve within the seasons before leaving?""",,,,,,
Mission_25,"""I suppose that's a question we all have to ask ourselves.""",,,,,,
Mission_25,"""Anyway, I shouldn't bother you with these thoughts. You have a lot of work ahead of you!""",,,,,,
Mission_26,"""Good morning! I hope you're still sleeping well in these freezing temperatures.""",,,,,,
Mission_26,"""You know, I was thinking last night about how I miss the sound of cicadas at nighttime.""",,,,,,
Mission_26,"""As a kid, I used to eat them all the time, roasted or fried. It was quite the delicacy!""",,,,,,
Mission_26,"""When I think about cicadas, I think about all the time they spend underground as nymphs, in darkness, sometimes for many years.""",,,,,,
Mission_26,"""And then they emerge into the light, sprouting their wings and singing their praises at the highest levels.""",,,,,,
Mission_26,"""A kind of resurrection, if you will. Truly a wonderful thing.""",,,,,,
Mission_27,"""Good morning!""",,,,,,
Mission_27,"""Christie the weather lady is here again with some important info. Come quick!""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""Morning!""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""Goodness! This weather is devastating. Nothing can make me go out in this blizzard!""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""I guess I shouldn't have said that in front of you, given that you have to go about your duties.""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""Well, I do wish you good luck. I'll say an extra prayer for you...for protection against freezing to death out there.""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""I'm reminded of this verse: 'Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail?'""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""The snow is God's creation, fierce and overwhelming, yet purposeful. In the same way that a blizzard obscures our view, life's storms often blind us to God's plan.""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""But we must trust that just as He commands the snow, He commands our lives with wisdom beyond our understanding.""",,,,,,
Mission_28,"""And when the storm passes, we will see the path He set for us, clearer than before.""",,,,,,
Mission_29,"""Morning.""",,,,,,
Mission_29,"""The storm rages on, eh?""",,,,,,
Mission_29,"""I'm reminded again of another verse.""",,,,,,
Mission_29,"""‘Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.'""",,,,,,
Mission_29,"""Even in the midst of nature's harshest conditions, the purity of the snow reflects the cleansing grace of God.""",,,,,,
Mission_29,"""When the storm settles, all that is left is a world washed clean, a reflection of the renewal He offers us in spirit.""",,,,,,
Mission_29,"""Isn't that wonderful?""",,,,,,
Mission_30,"""Good morning dear.""",,,,,,
Mission_30,"""Have you started counting down the days until your ship arrives?""",,,,,,
Mission_30,"""I can't believe your time here is coming to an end.""",,,,,,
Mission_30,"""Ugh, I must try not to think about it and enjoy your presence.""",,,,,,
Mission_30,"""People tend to look towards the future rather than enjoy the present. Always waiting for the next big thing.""",,,,,,
Mission_30,"""I find that to be a shame, because the present is such a gift!""",,,,,,
Mission_30,"""Even with this crazy weather, I know it's tempting to wish it was all over quickly, and we can't wait until that day comes, but it's important to enjoy this very moment, within this storm, and just be present.""",,,,,,
Mission_31,"""Good morning!""",,,,,,
Mission_31,"""I came across another verse in our readings last night:""",,,,,,
Mission_31,"""'Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.'""",,,,,,
Mission_31,"""It reminds me of God's mercy, how He covers our sins, making us new again.""",,,,,,
Mission_31,"""You know, I love how most of the verses regarding snow are used as metaphors for the forgiveness of our sins.""",,,,,,
Mission_31,"""Another one commonly used is 'cleansing fire', which is also extremely harsh. Sounds to me like the purifying process has to be a tough one.""",,,,,,
Mission_31,"""Something to contemplate as we go through the actual purifying process in the world that exists between this one and the next.""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""Good morning!""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""Second to last day! I bet you must be brimming with excitement.""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""Hopefully you've started wrapping up your tasks. I can imagine it must be pretty difficult to get anything done in this weather.""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""I'm told by Christie the Weather Lady that the storm may end tomorrow. We can only hope.""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""I read another interesting verse last night:""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""'He gives snow like wool; He scatters frost like ashes. He hurls down His hail like crumbs—who can withstand His icy blast?'""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""A truly humbling verse indeed.""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""It's no wonder why many civilizations and cultures have multiple deities assigned to the elements and the weather.""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""It can be difficult to comprehend that a single being is powerful enough to control all weather systems.""",,,,,,
Mission_32,"""But alas, such is the case.""",,,,,,
Mission_33,"""Goooood morning!!""",,,,,,
Mission_33,"""Can you believe it? The storm is finally over! I thought it was never going to end.""",,,,,,

NewTutorialFailed_1,"Ah, looks like you got carried away. No worries, you can always try again. That's the beauty of a tutorial level!",,,,,,
NewTutorialFailed_1,I've reset the time. Try to get to the Hospital before 12PM.,,,,,,
NewTutorialFailed_2,"Uh oh, you got caught by the Shetani.",,,,,,
NewTutorialFailed_2,"Remember, if the Shetani gets you, you lose some Faith Points, and undeposited money, and your total maximum Faith Points for the day is also reduced.

It's imperative you avoid the Shetani at all costs.",,,,,,
NewTutorialFailed_2,Let's try again. Head back to the Convent and avoid the Shetani.,,,,,,
NewTutorialFailed_3,"Uh oh, you ran out of time.",,,,,,
NewTutorialFailed_3,"Remember, the day always ends at midnight. You actually don't need to return to the Convent before midnight, but for the sake of this tutorial, let's try to get there before midnight.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_1,Welcome to the Tutorial. Let's get started.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_11,The most important thing to keep track of is your <b>Time</b>.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_11,"Time passes in the game only when you perform certain activities, so you can take all the (real world) time you need before making your next move.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_12,Let's try a Prayer Activity now.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_15,"Select the Prayer activity, take a look at its info panel to see how much time it will take, then press and hold to trigger it.

Keep an eye on the clock before you begin.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_2,Excellent! Pretty simple eh?,,,,,,
NewTutorial_2,"I hope you noted the time before you started. As you can see, time has passed.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_2,Time also passes when you move in the world.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_2,Let's demonstrate this by going to another building.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_25,Click the Exit button to go to the world view.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_3,"The world is made up of an 8x8 grid.

Movement on each square takes exactly <b>15 minutes.</b>",,,,,,
NewTutorial_3,"Knowing this, you can calculate how much time it will take to get to the Hospital over there!",,,,,,
NewTutorial_31,"Click on an adjacent square to move your character if using a mouse, otherwise use the D-pad or Joystick on your controller. 

Try to get to the Hospital before 12PM.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_35,"Oh, I forgot to mention. There are angel spirits called 'Ehi' that will pop up on the map.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_35,"Ehi will help you with building upgrades, and they never leave you, even after you've used them on an upgrade.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_35,"Try to collect as many as you can on your way to the Hospital, but don't get carried away! You still have to get to the Hospital before 12PM.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_4,You made it! Well done!,,,,,,
NewTutorial_4,"You can zoom in/out anytime you are inside a building by using the mouse wheel, or RT/LT on your controller.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_41,The next important thing you need to keep track of is your <b>Energy.</b>,,,,,,
NewTutorial_41,"Energy will be used to perform many activities, and you will not be able to perform them if you do not meet the Energy requirement for that activity.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_42,Let's try a Volunteer Activity now.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_43,"Select the Volunteer activity, take a look at its info panel to see how much time AND Energy it will take, then press and hold to trigger it, and keep an eye on the clock and your Energy!",,,,,,
NewTutorial_5,Nicely done! You're getting the hang of it.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_5,"You may have noticed in the info panels that there is a third icon. 

This icon is a reward that denotes either Faith Points, or Charity Points.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_51,"Faith Points are rewarded when you pray at any building, or complete a special prayer objective at the convent.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_52,Charity Points are rewarded any time you complete an objective at any building except the convent.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_53,"At the end of the game, both your total Faith Points and Charity Points are assessed, and the end game sequence will be determined by your scores.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_53,This means every day counts! Try to max out your Faith Points and Charity Points every day to get the best possible ending!,,,,,,
NewTutorial_6,"Let's head back to the Convent. 

Any money earned in the field needs to be deposited at the Convent's Treasury.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_6,"Unfortunately, the evil spirits known as 'Shetani' come out at night.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_6,"These are dangerous spirits, and coming into contact with them will drain you of some of your Faith Points and cause you to lose any money you have not deposited in the Treasury.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_6,"Furthermore, they will permanently reduce the maximum Faith Points you can acquire for the day.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_6,"Head back to the convent and avoid the Shetani at all costs.

Good luck!",,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,You made it! Well done!,,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,That concludes the tutorial. To recap:,,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,"Time is of utmost importance. Each day ends at midnight, and you have a limited number of days on this island, so make the most of it. ",,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,You can't perform activities without Energy.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,Your ultimate goal is to attain as many Faith Points and Charity Points before you leave this island.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,"Ehi are good spirits, you want as many as possible to aid with building upgrades.",,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,Shetani are evil spirits. Avoid them like the plague.,,,,,,
NewTutorial_7,Bye for now!,,,,,,
