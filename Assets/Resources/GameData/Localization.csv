Moses was so moved by the monks that he gave up his old way of life, became a Christian, was baptized and joined the monastic community at Scetes. He proved to be a prophetic spiritual leader, settling disputes within and outside the community of monks and sometimes carrying a leaking sack of sand on his shoulders to show humility.

After word came of an attack on the monastery by a group of Berbers, Moses ordered the others to leave while staying behind, believing his life had come full circle. He was joined by seven others, and together they were martyred by the bandits around 405 A.D.",,,,,,
PEDRO_Bio,"Saint Pedro Calungsod, a Filipino Roman Catholic, was a skilled sacristan and teacher of catechism. He accompanied Blessed Diego Luis de San Vitores to the Marianas Islands where many received the sacraments especially that of baptism.

A plot to have him killed began when a criminal named Choco began spreading false rumours that the baptismal water contained poison. Given that some sickly infants who were baptized eventually died, the story stuck and people began to despise the missionaries.

It came to head when the local chief, who now opposed the missionaries because of the rumours, learned of his newborn daughter's baptism. A violent assault followed, and Pedro, along with San Vitores, were killed in the attack. On October 21, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI canonized Calungsod in Saint Peter's Square.",,,,,,

SANMARTIN_Bio,"St. Martin de Porres was born in Lima, Peru. Being of mixed race, he experienced a great deal of ridicule as a young boy. The law in Peru at the time prevented Africans and Native Indians to become full members of religious orders, so Martin began as a servant boy at the Dominican Convent of the Rosary.

Martin worked hard and made his way up from church officer to lay brother and finally took his vows as a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic, granted by the prior who disregarded the racial laws that prohibited his entry. He cared for many people unconditionally, from Spanish nobles to African slaves.

Towards the end of his life, Martin fell very ill with chills, fevers and tremors causing him agonizing pain. He would suffer this illness for almost a year until his eventual death in 1639.",,,,,,

His relics are now part of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, built by Ambrose, fourth-century bishop of Milan.",,,,,,
