## How To Deploy to local xbox

### Create UWP Pacakge
1. Build Settings -> Player Settings
    1. Update Version here
        1. Note that this will not affect the version when creating the final UWP package in Visual Studio but that version should match what is set here for consistency.
1. Navigate to Build output directory
    1. In my case that is `C:\Users\lytai\Repos\Sainthood-Builds\3`
        1. Where the `3` at the end is typically incremented to separate builds. In theory, I could also use the version number from above to keep things consistent.
1. Open the `Sainthood.sln` file in visual studio
1. Right click on **Universal Windows** project and select publish -> Create App Package
    1. Sideloading is the method that will be used
1. Select *Yes, use the current certificate*
    1. I can't 100% remember, but I think that's generated by Unity when you do the build so this should be auto populated by the time you get here.
1. Output location should look similar to `C:\Users\lytai\Repos\Sainthood-Builds\3\AppPackages\Sainthood\`
1. Set version here again to match
1. Disable all architectures but x64. 
1. Click Create

### Deploy UWP Package to Xbox
1. I'm going to assume your xbox is already in dev mode. If not, look it up.
1. Get the remote access url
    1. If you set up a username and password in the remote access settings, well you're gonna need them. Or you can easily change it on the xbox if you can't remember it.
1. Back on your PC, navigate to the remote access url
    1. And surprise, enter the credentials (if they exist?) to gain access
1. Under the My Games & Apps section select Add a new game
    1. From my experience, you will need to delete any previous version of the game from the target xbox
1. Navigate to your UWP output directory which should look like `C:\Users\lytai\Repos\Sainthood-Builds\3\AppPackages\Sainthood\Sainthood_2.0.5.0_x64_Debug_Test`
1. Select the `.appx` file that's listed there and select next
1. For dependencies, navigate to the `x64` dependency directory and upload all files that are there `C:\Users\lytai\Repos\Sainthood-Builds\3\AppPackages\Sainthood\Sainthood_2.0.5.0_x64_Debug_Test\Dependencies\x64`
1. Click next. Hopefully it all works
